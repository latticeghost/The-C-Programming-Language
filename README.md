# The-C-Programming-Language

Note: The solutions are source codes and not object codes, so you need to compile them before executing using a C compiler such as 'gcc' or any C compiler of your choice. These solutions intend to solve the particular question in the chapter & may have constraints imposed and may not be generalized codes that can be used anywhere else.

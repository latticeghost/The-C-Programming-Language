# The-C-Programming-Language
Solutions to the problems in the book "The C Programming Language" by the inventor of the language, Brian W. Kernighan &amp; Dennis M. Ritchie. This book is also affectionately known as "K&amp;R"[61].

Note: The solutions are source codes and not object codes, so you need to compile them before executing using a C compiler such as 'gcc' or any C compiler of your choice. These solutions intend to solve the particular question in the chapter & may have constraints imposed and may not be generalized codes that can be used anywhere else.

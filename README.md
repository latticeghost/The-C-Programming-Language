# The-C-Programming-Language

Note: The solutions are <em>source codes</em> and not <em>object codes</em>, so you need to compile them before executing using a C compiler such as 'gcc' or any C compiler of your choice. These solutions intend to solve the particular question in the chapter & may have constraints imposed and may not be generalized codes that can be used anywhere else.
 <p>The solution to Exercise 1.10 is not present, as it needs the use of the standard library &lt;termios.h&gt;, which I haven't came across yet.</p>
